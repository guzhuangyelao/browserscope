  <h2>What is Reflow?</h2>
  <p>
    Reflow in a web browser refers to the process whereby the render engine calculates positions and geometries of elements in the document for purpose of drawing, or re-drawing, the visual presentation. Every browser has its own logic for doing, and
    sometimes not doing, these calculations. Dynamic changes to the
    document's styles and contents will cause reflow to occur - being
    mindful of the things that slow down this process can lead one to
    creating faster web pages.
  </p>


  <h2>How the Reflow Timer Works</h2>
  <p>
    Reflow Timer is a fairly naive Javascript-driven test to see how
    long it takes for the browser to return control to the Javascript
    engine following one or many changes done in script to an
    element. Before each test is performed, we attempt to flush the
    browser's render queue(if a browser uses this optimization) by asking
    for that element's offsetHeight. This idea was suggested by
    Mozilla's render-engine guru David Baron, and so it at least works
    in Gecko to cause the render engine to perform all queued-up
    changes - which is essential for correctly providing the
    calculated value of the element's fully rendered height. (See the
    ReflowTimer.flushRenderQueue_ method in
    <a href="{{ "js/reflow/reflow_timer.js"|resource_path }}">reflow_timer.js</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    One important caveat about the test results in the Reflow category is that they will vary based on a user's machine configuration. Since reflow uses CPU power, the times will likely vary a fair amount. Hopefully we'll get enough test results that the median is still interesting.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once satisfied that the render queue has been flushed, we
    give the browser a little time to rest, then set a timer. We
    perform whatever operations are in a particular test (almost always a set operation on element.style), and then we
    again flush the render queue and capture the time again right
    after that. We get the delta, and voila - we call that the reflow
    time.
  </p>

  <p>
    Initially the only test we were curious about was "what is the cost of a worst-case-scenario", i.e. full page reflow where everything has to be re-calculated from scratch. We wanted to a baseline. After doing a series of small experiments it became somewhat clear that there are lots of interesting things worth testing beyond that. At the moment, I feel like these tests are not covering the full breadth of what may be interesting to test here. Consider this a start. ;)
  </p>

  <p>
    This approach is certainly not flawless (Javascript timers can be @ 15ms inaccurate), but it appears to work in
    all browsers in non-debug builds - therefore giving us a time that
    should be something akin to what real-world users would experience in terms of the interaction-blocking time caused by reflow.

  <h2><SPAN id="logo">&#9728;</SPAN>SunSpider JavaScript Benchmark</h2>

  <P>This is SunSpider, a JavaScript benchmark. This benchmark tests the
  core JavaScript language only, not the DOM or other browser APIs. It
  is designed to compare different versions of the same browser, and
  different browsers to each other. Unlike many widely available
  JavaScript benchmarks, this test is:</P>

  <ul>
  <li>Real World</li>
  <p>This test mostly avoids microbenchmarks, and tries to focus on
  the kinds of actual problems developers solve with JavaScript today,
  and the problems they may want to tackle in the future as the language
  gets faster. This includes tests to generate a tagcloud from JSON
  input, a 3D raytracer, cryptography tests, code decompression, and
  many more examples. There are a few microbenchmarkish things, but they
  mostly represent real performance problems that developers have
  encountered.</p>

  <li>Balanced</li>
  <p>This test is balanced between different areas of the language and
  different types of code. It's not all math, all string processing, or
  all timing simple loops. In addition to having tests in many
  categories, the individual tests were balanced to take similar amounts
  of time on currently shipping versions of popular browsers.</p>

  <li>Statistically Sound</li>
  <p>One of the challenges of benchmarking is knowing how much noise
  you have in your measurements. This benchmark runs each test multiple
  times and determines an error range (technically, a 95% confidence
  interval). In addition, in comparison mode it tells you if you have
  enough data to determine if the difference is statistically
  significant.</p>
  </ul>

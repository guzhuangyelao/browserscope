  <a href="http://blog.whatwg.org/the-road-to-html-5-contenteditable">contenteditable</a>
  for basic rich text formatting commands. Most browser implementations do very
  well at editing the HTML which is generated by their own execCommands. But a
  big problem happens when developers try to make cross-browser web
  applications using contenteditable - most browsers are not able to correctly
  change formatting generated by other browsers. On top of that, most browsers
  allow users to to paste arbitrary HTML from other webpages into a
  contenteditable region, which is even harder for browsers to properly
  format. These tests check how well the execCommand, queryCommandState,
  and queryCommandValue functions work with different types of HTML. Please
  note that these are WYSIWYG editing tests, not semantic editing tests. Any
  HTML which produces a given visual style should be changeable via the
  execCommand for that style."""

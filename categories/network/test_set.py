If a browser doesn't block when downloading stylesheets (as measured by the previous test), then a stylesheet followed by
an image could both be downloaded in parallel.
But suppose an inline script block was placed between the stylesheet's <code>LINK</code> tag and the image <code>IMG</code> tag.
The result, for some browsers, is that the image isn't downloaded until the stylesheet finishes.
The reason is that the image download must occur after the inline script block is executed
(in case the script block itself inserts images or in some other way manipulates the DOM),
and the inline script block doesn't execute until after the stylesheet is downloaded and parsed
(in case the inline script block depends on CSS rules in the stylesheet).
It's important to preserve the order of the stylesheet rules being applied to the page, followed by executing the inline script block, but
there's no reason other resources shouldn't be downloaded in parallel and not applied to the page until after the inline script block is executed.
A subtlety of this test is that if the test is determined to be a failure if the inline script is executed before the stylesheet is done
downloading - although this is faster it could lead to unexpected behavior.'''),

    back in the old days, but now we've added more tests and they'd be lucky to get 6/12 (50%). If
    we compare 6/8 to newer browsers that get 8/12, the old browser would win, even though it would
    fail in side-by-side testing, so we have to use totalTests as the divisor for "score".
    But we can't misrepresent the actual tests that were performed, so we have to show the user the
    actual number of tests for which we have results, which means using totalValidTests as the divisor
    for "display".

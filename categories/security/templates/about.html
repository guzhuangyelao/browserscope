    This page contains a suite of security tests that measure
    whether the browser supports JavaScript APIs that allow safe
    interactions between sites, and whether it follows industry
    best practices for blocking harmful interactions between sites.
    The initial set of tests were contributed by
    <a href="http://www.adambarth.com/">Adam Barth</a>
    and <a href="http://www.collinjackson.com/">Collin Jackson</a>.
